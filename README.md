# python-3 repo
Just a quick repo where I can dump my python learning course code.

My plans for this are to have a piece of code that let's you check whether something is a prime, list primes continuously (until you press q or esc), or list primes between 2 integers. It will also save all previously generated primes to a file, so that if it needs to list them on another run of the script it won't have to recalculate them. Another file it will save to is a file in which it saves how long it took to generate that prime and how long it has taken to generate all the primes up to now.
